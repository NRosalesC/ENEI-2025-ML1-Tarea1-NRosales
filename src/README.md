### Deliverables
You must fork the [original repository](), and turn in a link to your groups repository with:

* A Jupyter notebook (in the `src` folder) with:

  * Your `numpy` implementations for OLS and gradient descent,
  * Plots: cost-function convergence, coefficient paths, predicted vs. actual values.
* A write-up in Markdown. Replace the contents of this file (`README.md`) with:
  
  * The names of your group's members,
  * Differences observed between OLS, Ridge, and Lasso,
  * Effect of learning rate on gradient descent,
  * How k-fold cross-validation influenced the choice of regularization strength.
